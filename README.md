# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum — a fun exercise to practice **JavaScript logic** and **DOM manipulation**.

It’s a simple browser-based **Rock Paper Scissors game** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player clicks on Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly chooses its move. Scores and rounds update dynamically in the browser.
